# World Population Exploratory Data Analysis

## Population Analysis  
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that analyzes global population data. The notebook performs data loading, cleaning, exploration, and visualization to uncover demographic trends and patterns across countries and regions.

## Dataset  
The dataset used in this analysis is **world_population.csv**, containing time-stamped records and demographic indicators for countries from 1970 through 2022.

## Analysis Steps  
The notebook follows these steps:

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**  
   - Import necessary libraries  
   - Load the dataset  
   - Handle missing values and correct data types  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**  
   - Calculate descriptive statistics (`.describe()`, `.info()`)  
   - Visualize distributions and relationships (histograms, box plots, scatter plots)  

3. **Time Series Analysis**  
   - Plot global population growth from 1970 to 2022  
   - Resample or aggregate by decade or year to highlight long-term trends  

4. **Comparative Visualizations**  
   - Bar charts for population distribution by continent and smallest-population countries  
   - Scatter plots comparing country area vs. population and population density vs. total population  

5. **Growth Rate Analysis**  
   - Compute country-level growth rates  
   - Plot normal distribution of growth rates  
   - Box plots of growth rate by continent  

## Tools Used  
- Python 3.x  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

## Findings  
- **Global Population Growth:**  The line plot shows a steady increase in total population over time, reflecting consistent global growth influenced by improved healthcare, lower mortality rates, and higher birth rates. There are no noticeable dips, indicating uninterrupted growth from 1970 to 2022.

- **Population Distribution by Continent:**  A bar plot reveals Asia as the most populous continent, followed by Africa and Europe. North and South America have moderate populations, while Oceania has the smallest share. The dominance of Asia is driven by large countries such as China and India.

- **Area vs. Population Relationship:**  The scatter plot indicates no direct correlation between a country’s land area and its population. Some small countries host large populations (e.g., urbanized states), whereas some large countries maintain relatively low populations, highlighting the influence of factors beyond geographic size.

- **Growth Rate Distribution:**  The normal distribution chart of country-level growth rates is left‑skewed, showing most countries experience moderate to high growth while a minority face low or negative growth rates. Negative or stagnant growth is typically seen in advanced economies or those with socio-economic challenges.

- **Regional Growth Rate Variability:**  Box plots by continent show Africa with the highest median growth rate and greatest variability, followed by Asia. Europe exhibits the lowest median growth. North America and Oceania fall in between, indicating diverse demographic dynamics across regions.

- **Historical Growth Trends (1970–2022):**  A detailed line chart illustrates world population rising from approximately 3.7 billion in 1970 to over 7.9 billion in 2022, underscoring the impact of medical and agricultural advancements on mortality and birth rates.

- **Smallest-Population Countries:**  A bar chart of the smallest countries by population highlights entities such as Vatican City, Tokelau, Niue, Falkland Islands, and Saint Pierre & Miquelon. Their low populations are linked to factors like geographic isolation and limited resources.

- **Population Density vs. Total Population:**  The scatter plot examining density (people per km²) against total population shows that high density does not always equate to high population. For example, Bangladesh has both high density and high total population, while the Falkland Islands have low density and population, emphasizing the role of urbanization and resource availability.

- **Continental Population Disparities:**  A final bar chart illustrates the total populations of each continent, reaffirming Asia’s leading position. Africa and Europe also hold substantial shares, while Oceania remains the least populated, highlighting region-specific challenges for resource management and policy planning.
